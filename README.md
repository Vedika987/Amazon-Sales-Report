# Amazon-Sales-Report
This project focuses on end-to-end data analysis of Amazon sales data to extract critical insights and trends that can help in strategic decision-making. 
The project begins by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, which involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, normalizing data formats, and transforming categorical data for analysis. Once the data was prepared, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using Pythonâ€™s Pandas and NumPy libraries to compute key statistics such as total revenue, average order value, and sales distribution across different regions.
Advanced visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present insights in a clear and interactive manner. These visualizations include revenue trends over time, category-wise sales comparison, top-selling products, and monthly/seasonal sales patterns. Special focus was given to identifying high-revenue-generating products and peak sales periods, which can help in inventory planning and marketing campaigns.

The final output is a comprehensive report, which includes key insights, actionable recommendations, and visual representations of findings. This project provided hands-on experience in working with large datasets, applying data analytics techniques, and building insightful dashboards.
